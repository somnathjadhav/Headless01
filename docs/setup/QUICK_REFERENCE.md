## 🐛 Issue Fixed
**Problem**: Cart items duplicating after page refresh  
**Root Cause**: WordPress cart was being added to localStorage cart instead of replacing it  
**Solution**: Added new action types to replace cart instead of adding to it

## 🔄 Cart Flow (Fixed)
1. App loads → Check authentication
2. If not authenticated → Load from localStorage
3. If authenticated → Load from WordPress (replaces localStorage cart)
4. All cart operations → Save to both localStorage and WordPress

## 🧪 Test After Deployment
1. Add items to cart
2. Refresh page
3. Verify no duplication
4. Test with authenticated users
5. Test with unauthenticated users
